As programs grow in complexity, additional layers of abstraction can be useful. One way to consolidate programs into manageable units is using object-oriented programming. What is important to realize is that object-oriented programming, unlike components like variables and flow control, is not central to solving any problem. Object-oriented programming is only a tool, and there can be detrimental ways to use this tool.
