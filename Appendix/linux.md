# Linux

To effectively use a compiler like g++ and work with C++ programs it is important to have a basic understanding of some fundamental Linux commands. These commands are the same regardless of the distribution or whether the programmer uses something like WSL. The Linux shell works by running commands from within a directory. Commands are either built-in or installed along with applications and other software.
