# C++ Basics

**Currently under construction.**

This repository consists of 14 folders that go through the basics of C++. This is intended for those with basic programming knowledge in Python as they learn C++. Any references are provided but these programs and documents are my own. This content works best as supplementary material alongside a course in C++.
