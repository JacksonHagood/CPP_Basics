# [C++ Basics](https://github.com/JacksonHagood/CPP_Basics) **Version 1.0**

This repository consists of 22 sections that go through the basics of C++. This is intended for those with basic programming knowledge in Python as they learn C++. Any references are provided but these programs and documents are my own. This content works best as supplementary material alongside a synchronous course in C++. Consult the Appendix for review and further material.

The early sections start by covering the basics of the language, before the later sections delve into two different programming paradigms. Functional and object-oriented programming are discussed in these later sections, but are best paired with a more theoretical understanding of the actual concepts. In other words, this repository focuses more on how these paradigms might be achieved in C++, rather than what they are conceptually.

A lot of this material works by virtue of examples. For more explicit definitions / specifications of these concepts, it is thought that a reference website (like cppreference.com) remains the best resource.

While the sections are arranged in roughly chronological order, some may find it useful to cover sections 19 - 21 earlier. Additionally, sections 12 - 14 could be skipped if the programmer intends to learn object-oriented programming exclusively.
